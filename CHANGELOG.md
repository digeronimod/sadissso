# Changelog

All the changes are now (and have been logged) by GitHub.

I've made roughly 830+ commits as of writing this in May 2022, with the project being active since December of 2019. I stopped maintaining this file back in the middle of 2021 during a collections or distribution period due to the sheer amount of pushes I'd make in a single day... and I didn't document my changes, because there were so many other things to manage and maintain at the time.

The moral of this story? Don't design an inventory and student management system from absolute scratch.

It's not fun...

Oh, who am I kidding? It's fun.
