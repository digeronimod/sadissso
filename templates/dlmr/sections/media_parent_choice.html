    <H3>Media Parent Choice</H3>
    <p>The district understands parents and guardians play a major role in guiding their childâ€™s reading and media center use. It is important that each family has the right to determine which library resources are acceptable for its children and that we afford that right to each family. The district strives to provide appropriate educational, intellectual and physical access to resources that provide for a wide range of abilities and differing points of view.  This process in no way negates our responsibility to ensure that the materials that are in our media centers align to state statutes but provides families with additional choice around all available media materials. </p>
