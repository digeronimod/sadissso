                        <p>Student learning is at the heart of all we do in Flagler County Public Schools. It is our belief that student learning is enhanced through the integration of technology with a strong curriculum, led by excellent teachers. Technology allows students and teachers to use an approach which is “hands on” and relevant to today’s learning. By approving the Half Penny Sales Tax, the community has given Flagler County Public Schools the opportunity to provide our students with digital tools to help actively engage them in their learning.</p>
                        <p>All students, Kindergarten to 12th Grade, will be required to register for the Flagler County Public Schools Digital Learning Movement.</p>
